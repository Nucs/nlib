# nucs.Automation

Automation library aims to provide a simple async-task library to simulating both keyboard and mouse with essential classes to provide a way to automate any action on your pc.

#### Capabilities

##### Simulating
- `Mouse` - static mouse simulator (instance of `MouseController` w/o interface).
    - `Move(Point xy, double velocity)` - moves the cursor in a realistic way.
    - `MoveAbsolute(Point)` - moves the cursor instantly to the given point.
    - `Click(MouseButton)` - click in the current location.
    - `DoubleClick(MouseButton)` - you guessed it!
    - `MoveRelative()` - Move the mouse relativly to the mouse current location.
    - `MiddleClick()` ,`RightClick()` ,`DragDrop(Point from, Point to)`, `LeftDown()`, `LeftUp()`, `WheelDown()`, `WheelUp()` and so on...
- `Keyboard` - static keyboard simulator (instance of `KeyboardController` that implements `IModernKeyboard`).
    - `Keyboard.Write(string)` - types down a string
    - `Keyboard.Press(KeyCode)` - presses a keyboard button - duhh
    - `Keyboard.Control(KeyCode)` - presses a button while holding Control, exists for `Shift`, `Win` and `Alt`.
    - Some more similar actions

##### Mirroring  - Windows Reflection
- SmartProcess - A cached version of an existing `Process` type with some neat features
    - `WaitForExitAsync()` - async wait for the process to exit.
    - `WaitForRespondingAsync()` - async wait for the process to be able to accept input.
    - `Windows` - property - returns all instances of `Window` associated to this window.
    - `MainWindow` - property - returns an instance of `Window` of the MainWindow of this process
    - All methods available in Process including `OGProcess` prop to access the native process
    - Static Methods
        - `SmartProcess.Get(string processname)` - Gets cached or caches the first process with the name `processname`
        - `SmartProcess.Get(Process)` - Gets cached or caches the passed process.
        - `SmartProcess GetCached(Guid)` - Gets a cached SmartProcess that has the given guid (accessable from SmartProcess instance `smartproc.GUID`)
- Window
    - `WaitForRespondingAsync()` - async wait for the process to be able to accept input.
    - `ChangeWindowState(WindowState)` - minimize, maximaze or normal the window.
    - `SetWindowSize(Size)` - changes the window size.
    - `SetWindowPosition(x, y)` - moves the window to the given xy.
    - `IsFocused` - is it foreground atm?
    - `Title` - returns the window's title.
    - `IsVisible` - is it currently visible on the screen otherwise it is a part of a UI window.
    - `IsValid` - does the window still exist?
    - `Position` - returns a `Rectangle` of the window's position and size.
    - `BringToFront` - sets the window as foreground / focused.
    - `Mouse` - is an instance of `RelativeMouse` that any clicks using this property will result in relative clicking to the window's boundries.
    - `Keyboard` - is essentially same as static `Keyboard`.
    - Static Methods
        - `Create(SmartProcess process, HWND handle)` creates a window object.
       
##### Starter - static class with basic methods
	- `Run(string application)`- runs a program using WIN+R with administrator elevation.
	- `RunUsingProcessStart(string application)` - runs a program in the oldschool with highest possible elevation.
	- `Cmd(params string[] scripts)` - starts a cmd and runs a sequence of commands.
	
#### Real-World Example
This example will run a program using WIN+R and will return the process that has opened.
```C#

var application = "notepad++.exe"

var sproc = SmartProcess.Get("explorer"); //Find the explorer process
await Task.Yield(); //Make the rest code below async!
_recapture:
//Find a window in explorer process that is a Run window.
var win = sproc.Windows.FirstOrDefault(w => w.Type == WindowType.Run); 
if (win == null) { //if it does not already exist - create one.
	Keyboard.Window(KeyCode.R); //press WIN+R
	goto _recapture;
}

win.BringToFront(); //make sure it is in the front
await win.WaitForRespondingAsync(); //wait till the window is able to accept input - important for slow PCs

win.Keyboard.Write(application); //Equivalent to Keyboard.Write(...) but this call makes sure it is sent to the window!
win.Keyboard.Enter(); //Press enter which will launch the run-line command
Thread.Sleep(200); //some delay to let the program actually open

//Get the process

	var p = Process.GetProcesses().ToArray();
var foreground = SmartProcess.GetForeground();
if (foreground.ProcessName == application) //is foreground the new application?
	return foreground;
//Foreground is not the given application! find the newest from all processes
var newest = Process.GetProcesses().Where(proc=>proc.ProcessName==application).OrderByDescending(pp => {
		try {
			return pp.StartTime.Ticks;
		} catch {
			return 0;
		}
	}).FirstOrDefault();
}
return newest;

```
